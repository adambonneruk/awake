## Background and Information
This simple windows app keeps a machine/workstation from going idle. Oriignally this application pressed the Scroll Lock button twice every second to keep windows "awake". The recent version now uses a native windows call "```ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED```" to keep the display on instead.

I built this tool to solve a problem, learn about ```tkinter```, ```pyautogui``` and python ```threading```. Displaying a basic GUI while a second thread takes care of the automation. Whilst the latest version is much more efficient/compact, you can still see that code in as recent as the [v0.4.0](https://github.com/adambonneruk/awake/tree/v0.4.0) tag.

## Usage
The App starts in the system tray (with the _Z_ icon).

A right-click context menu allows you to "```Start/Pause```" the program (pausing will allow windows to sleep again, this is represented by ‚è∏ icon) or "```Quit```" and close the application.

## Development

### Python venv and pip
```ps
# create a venv named venv
py -m venv venv

# run venv
venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

# install pip prereqs
py -m pip install -r .\requirements.txt --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --trusted-host pypi.org

# list pip installs inside the venv
pip freeze
```

### Compile
```ps
# compile manually
pyinstaller 'src/awake.spec' --noconfirm

package with nsis manually
makensis 'installer/awake.nsi'
